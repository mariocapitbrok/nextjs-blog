          I am passionate about technology and code. JavaScript particularly
          catches my attention at this moment because it opens up many
          possibilities for web programming. I like to code, design websites,
          applications and keep up to date with new technological advances. I am
          recently certifying my knowledge to give security to companies that
          place their trust in me and my team. I also try in my free time to
          continue doing code challenges to improve my skills as a developer.
